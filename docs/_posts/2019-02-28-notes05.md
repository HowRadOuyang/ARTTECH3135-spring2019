Hi!

Code posted [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-spring2019) and the assignment is [here](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-spring2019/assignments/05a.html)

- We will push back the computer vision stuff for now. I thinking parsing JSON will be really useful, especially since we are working in JS and the web currently

- Here is another great JS reference: [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/){: target= '_ blank'}. The book has been around for awhile and has gone through some revisions.  It might use different coding conventions ( an older style maybe), but is still a great resource.

Thanks all.
