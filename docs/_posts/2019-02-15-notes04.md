Hi!

Code posted [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-spring2019) and the assignment is [here](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-spring2019/assignments/04a.html)

- Next week we will go over forces, look at parsing JSON for getting external data into our sketches, and get everyone setup with git and github.
- We will push back the computer vision stuff for now. I thinking parsing JSON will be really useful, especially since we are working in JS and the web currently

- Here is another great JS reference: [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/){: target= '_ blank'}. The book has been around for awhile and has gone through some revisions.  It might use different coding conventions ( an older style maybe), but is still a great resource.

Thanks all.  Great work in class. I really appreciate it.
