### Course Description
This studio course investigates the creative possibilities in programming, from interactivity to information visualization. Students explore interactive narratives and games, software art, simulations and emergent behaviors, and other code-based forms. Lectures, discussions, and demonstrations provide a conceptual, aesthetic and technical foundation in programming as a creative practice.

### Course Goals

__Key goals include:__

- Intermediate working knowledge of creative coding tools and techniques.
- Working knowledge of the landscape of contemporary open source coding tools.
- Working knowledge of coding tools such as Git, Xcode, Terminal, etc.
- Working knowledge of contemporary artists and groups that shape the fields of interactive art and creative code.

### Course Values
