## Code
- Working off of the colorFromImage example we did in class, create a sketch that:
    - adds movement to the mover class
    - adds an interactive element, either from the mouse or a key press.
    - or maybe something happens/changes after a certain amount of time.
- Do not feel that you have to eventually "show" the image. You can be as abstract as you want.
- We will look at your sketches in class next week. But please e-mail your code, or a link to it, to me by Wednesday 8pm.
