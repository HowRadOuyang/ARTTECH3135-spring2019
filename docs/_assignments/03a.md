## Code
- Create an animated composition using a periodic signal such as `sin()` and/or `cos()`, or even a `%`.
- Use the [gifFrame_saver template](https://editor.p5js.org/ajbajb/sketches/NVLCE3Ine){:target="_ blank"} to save a sequence of frames.
- Assemble the image sequence to create a looping .gif, either by using [http://gifmaker.org/](http://gifmaker.org/){: target='_ blank'}, your favorite Photoshop-esque program, or by sending me your image sequence.
- Send me your .gif or image sequence __by Wednesday 8pm CST__.
- If you are interested in [Lenticular prints](https://gifpop.io/), let me know and I will see about getting some printed.
