## Code
- Create your custom class.
- This class should include the following:
    1. This class should have at least 3 properties and there methods.
    2. This class should interact with the mouse in some way.
    3. This class should interact with the edges of the canvas in some way, be creative and make up your rules.
    4. This class _should not_ be displayed as an ellipse, circle, or ball. Give the class your own custom look.

- If you haven't already, please install [X-Code](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/){: target= '_ blank'}. (Mac only).  It is a rather large DL, so it will save is all a lot of time if you install this _before_ class.
