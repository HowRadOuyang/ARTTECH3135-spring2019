__Code__
Choose a Vera Molnar piece and, using it as inspiration, create a sketch that reproduces, mimics, references, or simply comments on the piece. What, to you, are the more important defining aspects to this piece? What draws you to it? Try to capture that in your sketch.
Please include these elements:
- Iteration (think `for()` loops)
- Variation (think `random()` ) _reminder_ Think of the different ways we discussed to use & control `random()`
- Control -- include a mouse or keyboard interaction to control or vary an aspect of the sketch.

A few Molnar pieces I like:
- [Disparition](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/130)
- [Interruptions](http://dam.org/artists/phase-one/vera-molnar/artworks-bodies-of-work/works-from-the-1960s-70s)
- [Dialog Between Emotion and Method](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/127)
