## Code
# MID-TERM ASSIGNMENT
__Project Due: March 21__

_email me your proposal / idea no later than March 14th, preferably before_

This assignment will let you apply what you have learned in class thus far in a creative project of your choosing.
- Go back and look at your sketches / assignments and see if there is anything you would like to expand on.
- Look through the examples / code from class. Perhaps you would like to expand on one or more of those ideas.
- Your project must include:
    - An interactive element
        - a key press, mouse press, mouse move, or mouse drag.
    - Some sort of change or progression.
        - This can be an animation, but not limited to animation.
    - Use of data
        - a data set from an external .json file, or
        - an API call where you fetch remote data, or
        - you can create your own JSON data.
- Give yourself plenty of time to complete this project. You may need to do a series of smaller sketches before the final one, and give yourself time for revisions.  I will be happy to look at / review your code before the 21st.
- Consider your resources, such as the class Github, the p5.js forum , the ATS Community forum, the class Slack channel, and - not mentioned before - a search on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){: target= '_ blank'}
- Please get in touch with questions or concerns.

- You will present your project in class on March 21st.
